### How to get a free GitHub Pro account

If you are in high school or university and are interested in coding, you should consider signing up for GitHub education. This allows you to use GitHub Pro, as well as have many other benefits. If you do not already have a GitHub account, you will need to create one. Sign in with your personal email address (so you can use your account even after your school email address gets deactivated when you graduate).

Next, go to settings and click Emails. Here is where you will add your school email to your GitHub account.



Add your school email address and verify. Once it is verified, go to https://education.github.com/. This will allow you to be eligible for GitHub Pro.

Click Sign in.



Then, head to Benefits. Scroll down and click Get student benefits.



Select Student as your academic status. Scroll down and use your school email address. After that, you have to select your school name as your school. Using a few sentences, explain why you are using GitHub.

Once you have completed those steps, press continue.

You’ll need to verify you’re a student at your school. Therefore, upload a screenshot of an email from your school board or another official school document. It’ll take a few days to verify, so you’ll have to wait until then.

### How to get a free Replit Hacker Plan

Once you have GitHub Pro, you’ll have access to many other benefits as well. One of the most notable benefits is a free Replit Hacker Plan for one year. 

If you don’t have a Replit account, create one with your personal email address (so you can use your account even after you school email address gets deactivated when you graduate)

Next, head to Account.



Scroll down to Connected services and connect your GitHub account.



Therefore, you should have GitHub Pro (until you graduate) and Replit Hacker (for one year).

Enjoy!
