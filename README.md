	      How to get a free GitHub Pro account
	    </h3>
	    <p>
	      If you are in <b>high school or college/university</b> and are interested in coding, you
	      should consider signing up for GitHub education. This allows you to use
	      GitHub Pro, as well as having many other benefits. If you do not already
	      have a <a href="https://github.com/signup">GitHub</a> account, you will
	      need to create one. Sign in with your personal email address (so you can
	      use your account even after your school email address gets deactivated
	      when you graduate).
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Next, go to settings and click Emails. Here is where you will add your
	      school email to your GitHub account.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <img

	        alt="image1"
	      />
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Add your school email address and verify it. Once it is verified, go to
	      <a href="https://education.github.com/">https://education.github.com/</a>.
	      This will allow you to be eligible for GitHub Pro. Sign in with your
	      GitHub account.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Then, head to Benefits. Scroll down and click
	      <strong>Get student benefits</strong>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <img
	        src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97064249/215526941-b1a1e2fc-bcd9-4edd-bf8e-61a4e1cd82ac.png"
	        alt="image2"
	      />
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Select <strong>Student</strong> as your academic status. Scroll down and
	      use your school email address. After that, you have to select your school
	      name as your school. Using a few sentences, explain why you are using
	      GitHub.
	    </p>
	    <p>Once you have completed those steps, press continue.</p>
	    <p>
	      You’ll need to verify you’re a student at your school. Therefore, upload a
	      screenshot of an email from your school board or another official school
	      document. It’ll take a few days to verify, so you’ll have to wait until
	      then.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      After that has been completed, you should see your dashboard looking
	      something like this:

	        alt="image3"
	      />
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      You&#39;ll have the options for many student benefit offers, including a
	      $200 Digital Ocean credit, a free domain from Namecheap, and the JetBrains
	      IDE. However, in this tutorial you will be learning how to get the Replit
	      Hacker plan for free (which is not mentioned as a student benefit offer).

	    </h3>
	    <p>
	      Once you have GitHub Pro, you’ll have access to many other benefits as
	      well. One of the most notable benefits is a free Replit Hacker Plan for
	      one year.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      If you don’t have a Replit account, create one with your personal email
	      address (so you can use your account even after you school email address
	      gets deactivated when you graduate)
	    </p>
	    <p>Next, head to Account.</p>
	    <p>
	      <img

	        alt="image4"
	      />
	    </p>
	    <p>Scroll down to Connected services and connect your GitHub account.</p>
	    <p>
	      <img
	        src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97064249/215528283-8895bb3e-fb70-4d7c-87b3-3d3852e8c6c7.png"
	        alt="image5"
	      />
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Therefore, you should have GitHub Pro (until you graduate) and Replit
	      Hacker (for one year).
	    </p>
	    <p>Enjoy!</p>
